My Markdown Previewer project from the <em>Front End Development Libraries</em> section offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## Credits

### Packages

- [MarkedJS](https://marked.js.org/) - For parsing markdown.
- [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) - For syntax highlighting within the markdown.

### Other

This project was built to resemble the [example](https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/) provided for the project by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), in both visuals and functionality.

Certain choices within the code (usage of certain ids/certain functionality) were made in order to be in accordance with the user stories and pass the tests put forward by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). For a complete list of the requirements, you can visit the [project page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).
